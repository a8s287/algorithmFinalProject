# Algorithm Final Project

This repository contains the final project for the Algorithm course. The project demonstrates the implementation of an **NP-complete problem-solving algorithm**, designed and executed based on research papers and other academic resources.

## Overview

The main objective of this project was to:
- Select a method for solving an NP-complete problem based on research and analysis.
- Implement the chosen algorithm.
- Evaluate its efficiency and correctness.

## Recent Edits and Enhancements

I recently made updates and improvements to the project, which include:
1. **Code Refactoring**: Enhanced the structure and readability of the code for better maintainability.
2. **Optimization**: Implemented optimizations to improve the efficiency of the algorithm.
3. **Bug Fixes**: Resolved several issues that were identified during testing, ensuring smoother execution.
4. **Documentation**: Added comments and explanations to clarify the logic and methodology used in the code.
